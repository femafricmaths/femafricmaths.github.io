# Female African Mathematicians

## About us:
We are a network of female African mathematicians transforming Africa with mathematics.

At Femafricmaths, we interview female African Mathematicians to highlight the different career options available when you study mathematics. Our videos are available on our YouTube, Faceboook and Instagram pages.

We also promote the study of mathematics in primary and secondary schools. This comes under the Y3p3maths project which involves volunteers teaching mathematics in person or online. The goal is to support students to study, understand and apply mathematics. Videos of lessons covered during Y3p3maths are available on the Femafricmaths Facebook and YouTube pages.

What course do you need to study in order to become an astronaut? Our mentoring for senior high school girls provides guidance to female students on subject to choose when they go to the university. Mathsqueens will be available online to share their career journey with the young girls to guide them in their choice of courses and careers.


## Mission:
To inspire young people about the diverse career choices available after completing a degree in mathematics through interviews with #mathsqueens and school outreach activities.

## Vision:
To see young girls become confident to choose a career in mathematics related fields.

## Achievements:
We have interviewed about twenty female African mathematicians who are pursuing careers in academia and industry. Videos can be found [here](https://youtu.be/beVI19E9u8I)
